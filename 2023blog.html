        <h1 class="blog-header">Increasing Awareness about Deforestation</h1>
        <h2 class="author-info">Ayan Patel - 2023</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            This July, we took another trip to Zimba. We were thrilled to continue our robotics camp initiative this year, building on our past successes while expanding our efforts with a deforestation seminar. 
            <br><br> 
            While talking with Mr. Passwell Nyambe about the Kocebuka foundation and their work in aiding with various issues in southern Zambia, I learned about how the continuous need for fuel has led to mass deforestation in the country. The widespread use of firewood and charcoal as primary sources of energy has put immense pressure on Zambia's forests, threatening numerous environmental impacts. 
            <br><br> 
            After learning about this, we felt compelled to take action to help raise awareness for these issues. We were able to partner with a school in Zimba to host our deforestation seminar which around 100 people attended. In the seminar, we discussed the causes and consequences of deforestation, emphasizing its impact on biodiversity, climate change, and the community. At the end, we highlighted how each person can help by using less wood products and choosing alternatives such as excess biomass from farming.  
            <br><br>
            Following the seminar, we were eager to translate awareness into tangible action. With the support of those who attended our seminar, we planted 100 trees at the school. Within an hour, we were able to plant all the saplings and take a step in the right direction. Once grown, these trees will produce various fruits and nuts that will serve as another food source for the students. The excess produce will be sold at the local market to provide income for educational supplies. 
            <br><br> 
            In addition to the deforestation seminar, we were able to contribute to the local library. Last year, another volunteer had set-up a server with educational content for the students. I noticed that some of the students had trouble using laptops at the library to use the server, so I created a typing trainer program to help them improve their computer skills. I was able to upload this onto the server along with creating directions to help students get started. 
            <br><br>
            Our trip this year was extremely successful. We have received some updates from the school about how the students enjoy taking care of the trees. They water them daily and have tracked their growth for the past few weeks. We hope the trees continue to grow, and we are excited to see the progress on our next trip!
