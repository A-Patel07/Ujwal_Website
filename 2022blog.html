        <h1 class="blog-header">The First Robotics Camp!</h1>
        <h2 class="author-info">Ayan Patel - 2022</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
            This summer, we embarked on our second journey to Zambia with a bold new initiative: introducing a robotics camp to promote STEM amongst passionate students. 
            <br><br>
            Our vision stemmed from my experience participating in the FIRST LEGO League, a program that ignited my passion for technology. Through this program, I discovered firsthand how robotics can stimulate curiosity, foster creativity, and develop critical problem-solving skills. Witnessing the impact that robotics had on myself, I wanted to share this experience with others students who may not have access to similar resources.
            <br><br>
            The goal for this program was to create an environment where students could combine technical skills with practical ones. We aimed to introduce them to the fundamentals of robotics and programming through hands-on challenges similar to the ones I had in the FIRST LEGO League. By working together to develop and program a robot, the students would develop not only technical skills, but a mindset of innovation and teamwork. Our vision extended beyond the duration of the robotics camp. We wanted to empower students with the knowledge and confidence to continue exploring STEM fields independently. 
            <br><br> 
            With the help of Mr. Passwell Nyambe and the Kocebuka foundation, an organization that addresses various issues in southern Zambia, we were able to achieve our goal. On our first day, we visited the Hillcrest Technical School located in Livingston, Zambia  where we were warmly welcomed by the students and faculty. Throughout the camp, the students eagerly immersed themselves in robotics. They worked through each of the challenges, trying various ideas and cheering at each successful run.
            <br><br> 
            We held another robotics camp at the Zimba Secondary School where we were met with the same enthusiasm and eagerness. After the camp, we left a robot with both schools so they could continue learning. 
            <br><br> 
            I’ve kept in contact with a few of the students and teachers. They’ve reached out to share some videos and their ongoing excitement about robotics and STEM education. Some of the students have been experimenting with the robots we left behind, exploring new programming techniques and tackling more advanced challenges.
